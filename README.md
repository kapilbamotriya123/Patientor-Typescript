# Patientor-Typescript
Patientor App (TypeScript & MERN Stack)
Developed a hospital management system to learn TypeScript. The app manages patient records, including different types of medical entries (check-ups, hospital visits, employee health checks).
Focused on:

Strong typing for data integrity
Custom types for various medical entries
Error handling and user notifications

Main challenge: Implementing robust type checking between frontend and backend.
Key takeaway: The power of TypeScript in catching errors early and improving code quality.
